# 📚 AI-Based Interactive Learning Platform

Welcome to the repository for the AI-Based Interactive Learning Platform — an innovative, intelligent web application designed to provide real-time academic assistance to students using AI-powered technology.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project aims to address a common issue faced by learners: the lack of timely academic support during self-study. Built with a modern full-stack architecture, this platform acts as a 24/7 AI tutor that answers student queries instantly using natural language processing via the Gemini API.

The system provides:
- Instant, AI-generated answers to student questions
- Secure authentication with session-based access
- Historical chat tracking and subject-specific assistance
- A clean and responsive user dashboard for review and progress tracking

By combining the power of Next.js, Flask, Supabase, and Gemini, the platform ensures accessibility, scalability, and seamless interaction — empowering students across educational backgrounds to learn effectively and independently.
